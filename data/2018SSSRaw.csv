","","","","I have had good experience with registering for classes up until this semester. I am an International Business major and the amount of classes that I have available to take are limited in the first place, and this spring semester I have to take both of my ""pick 2"" classes. In the ""pick 2"" category, there are only two international classes, and one has not been offered in the fall or spring, and the other one was being offered in the spring, which I registered for, and now it has been cancelled. I am extremely upset by this because I already feel I lack a lot of knowledge with a global perspective, because any regular business class I have taken here barely touches on any sort of global insight. This is very unfortunate for International Business majors because the majority of our classes are standard business classes, and we are totally missing out on the ""international"" part of our major.   Also, the class I am replacing the one that got cancelled with is likely to be cancelled as well, which is going to screw up my schedule and internship.","","","","","","","Agree","Agree","Strongly Agree","Agree","Disagree","Agree","Agree","Disagree","Agree","Agree","Agree","Agree","Agree","","","","","Most of the business department is ad-junct faculty, and the majority of classes I have taken with these ad-junct professors are taught terribly. It is evident that these professors are knowledgeable in their field, but there teaching abilities are just not what they should be. They often lack structure and create very obscure assignments.   For example, I am taking Emerging Global Markets right now with Judy Ross, and I was very excited about this course because it pertains most with what I would like to do post-grad, and I am so dissatisfied with how the course has gone because the instruction is so bad. Assignments will be sprung on us randomly and make it hard to balance all of my other school work, the professor often doesn't start class until around 10 minutes in, and it doesn't seem like the professor is working off any syllabus and just kind of making it up as she goes.

Also, no one reaches out to other students and asks them to join them (ie. at dinner, etc.). This was something very prevalent at my old school and it was a nice feeling.","There is nothing to do and no one is around. Also, the dining halls hours are poor. Breakfast at 9:30 is too late and dinner ending at 7 is too early.","The site was freezing when I was trying to register due to the number of people trying to access it. I was also finding it hard to get classes that fit together because there were not enough sections offered that did not conflict with other classes. My old school assigned each student a specific time that they were able to register for classes (ie. 9:35 am) which meant that technological problems were not a big deal. ","The RAs do not seem to enforce the rules which makes it a bit annoying. Also, the bathrooms are poorly maintained. I watched the cleaning woman one day and she cleans the toilets with water from the toilet bowl and that is disgusting.","","","I wish there were more vegetable options.

For example, I had to search the website for how I was to do laundry on campus because I was not sent information about that before moving in and when I found the information online it was not in the place that someone would think to look for it.

As a student with a disability, it is incredibly difficult to walk across campus to the Arnie Campus Center stop in a timely manner to be able to get on the shuttle there on time. I also wish that the shuttle offered an increased amount of convenience for commuters. Even though it is great that the shuttle stops at Riverside, the ride from Riverside to connect to another train line can sometimes be over an hour. I believe that the shuttle should consider making trips to stops on the MBTA other than the green line or running an occasional shuttle that connects to a nearby Commuter Rail station so that commuters can connect to the train line that brings them closer to their home quicker.

I also feel that there should be computer labs available to students 24/7 near where their classes are held so that they can easily access their assignments, and print them as needed, before this class. This would especially be helpful for Commuter students like myself since the library does not open until 7:30 and by the time that I would be able to print my paper and go to the Science and Technology building, I'd be late for my 8:00am class.

I had my health plan waived, and it was $1812 so all that was left was $2188. After that, a scholarship of $2500 was sent for the whole year. After that was applied to my financial package all that was left for me to pay out of pocket was $938. I spent $1000 plus out of pocket, and that mess me up financially because I am a commuter, I had to pay for school, meal plan, MBTA pass and still take care of stuff at home. So they mess me up financially by telling me that's what my total would be and then only to find out that it wasn't a quarter into the first semester.

Twenty-five swipes for $135 for a whole semester are outrageous. I have early classes and afternoon classes, and I have a long commute home, so I occasionally have to wait when I get home to eat a meal because I am on a budget.
