What is even more of an issue is that shuttle services end at 4:50pm on Saturdays and Sundays. Many students leave campus on the weekends, especially for work, and may have to get back to Riverside later than 4:50pm.

And now that late night dining has returned, we can't use a meal swipe. 1851 is very expensive and it's often around $9 for a sandwich with no side or drink. There need to be more opportunities for students to use a meal swipe, other than the dining hall. In addition, I wish that 1851 still had the larger salad options they had during previous semesters. I used to eat a salad from the Glow Lounge or 1851 several times a week. The lack of options for dining makes it harder to eat healthy.

(I had to arrive at the T at the half-hour mark which is now when the shuttle goes elsewhere and I could not take the earlier or later shuttle since leaving early would mean taking time off work and leaving late would mean arriving late to my appointment.) It doesn't matter any more for me since I have no other plans to go into the city; it just bothered me that it made my travel that much more difficult (especially since the change was put in place the week of my appointment).","","","","My issue is more with the restrictions of the financial aid process at Lasell than the office itself. My mom didn't file her taxes in the year that we included on my FAFSA (and we stated that she had not filed on the FAFSA). While that was fine with the government, I was told by the Office of Financial Aid that I needed to present her taxes in order to get any kind of reward or have her sign a form stating that she did file taxes but they were just not accepted by the government yet (which she did not yet do) so even though I have the need, I was awarded no financial aid for this year (other than my merit scholarship).","","","","","Strongly Agree","Agree","Strongly Agree","Strongly Agree","Strongly Agree","Strongly Agree","Strongly Agree","","Strongly Agree","Strongly Agree","Strongly Agree","Strongly Agree","Strongly Agree","Agree","Strongly Agree","Strongly Agree","Strongly Agree","Strongly Agree","Agree","Disagree","There is a commitment to academic excellence but I do feel more could be done as I know some people who are just trying to get by enough to graduate. The residence halls are comfortable even if mine is a little cold right now. I feel listened to as a student and I know we value academic integrity. We have a great sense of school spirit (probably due to all of our great events). I wasn't this semester able to register for the course types I wanted; I'm not great with online learning since it's more difficult to stay focused and remember assignments than in person, but all but one of my classes this term were online (the other was a flex class meeting once online and once in person each week). Faculty are usually available for office hours, but after class is now a difficulty if they are online (ex. they shut off the call before you can ask to talk to them). I have had positive experiences with individuals different than myself and that I would say is all thanks to the IC3 and the Donahue Institute for DEI on campus. Tuition paid I think is a worthwhile investment, but I don't pay a lot due to my scholarship. The faculty do care about me. I was able to register for all the classes I need without issues.

I just wish there were a few more (even if it involved only spreading out the ones from during the week-I can name at least 2 days this week that have 2-3 programs happening at the exact same time so while I want to go to all of them I'll only get to go to one each day).","Strongly Agree","Agree","Disagree","Agree","Strongly Agree","Strongly Agree","Strongly Agree","Strongly Agree","I feel like some faculty could better take into account student differences when they teach classes (and also that others should take them into account less).

Knowing I didn't go through the puberty I wanted to go through still wasn't pleasant. I've also seen the opposite happen where some faculty decided that based on a student's identity they should be able to answer specific questions for the class or be assigned certain topics (I've mostly seen this happen to international students-especially those from Saudi Arabia-where they were asked to cover things like immigration or the international political climate while the rest of us got to pick any topic we wanted).","Strongly Agree","Strongly Agree","Strongly Agree","","Strongly Agree","Strongly Agree","Strongly Agree","","","","Very Easy","Very Easy","Very Easy","Very Easy","Safe","Disagree","Strongly Disagree","Strongly Agree","Hours:","17","I don't know or not applicable","","Hours:","22","I don't know or not applicable","","Hours:","3","I don't know or not applicable","","6","4 or more","Much better than I expected","Definitely","Definitely","","1","Trans/Non-Binary","","Heterosexual or Straight","","Find ways to crack down on students not following the COVID-19 policies without making other students do it. I know that this is difficult since we don't want to make any group (ex. professors, campus police) seem untrustworthy or forceful but at the same time I see far more people wearing masks incorrectly/not at all than I am comfortable. I feel like right now the burden is on students to tell other students (with this being especially on RAs who are asked to document all instances that they see even when not on duty). It's frustrating since even when I say something (ex. at the library I have to remind students using the study rooms that they still need to wear masks at least once a week), the students seem to only follow it until I'm gone (ex. I've seen people have their masks down and pull them up when an RA walks in). I have also heard of students faking their Co-verified results by showing screenshots of past green days which means that even having that check doesn't ensure safety at events/classes. I just want us to be safe and be able to stay open, but given the increase of COVID cases on campus along with these concerns I feel like it won't be able to happen.  I think also just finding ways to make this all feel more normal, but I have no answers on how to do that. It's weird going straight from the cafeteria to my room to eat since I'm not allowed to eat in any buildings and it's cold outside. It's weird having to be vigilant on if my neighbors in my dorm have people over. It's weird wearing a mask at all times out of my room even when I'm outside completely alone (I know that this is also part of the governor's mandate and is not only a rule of Lasell). I'm willing to do it because I want to stay safe and have Lasell stay open; I just wish this wasn't such a weird year. I still have Lasell traditions I haven't gotten to experience because of the pandemic and I worry that I'll never get to experience them (ex. Last year was going to be my first torch-light, my first spring week, and my first Marathon Monday here, but now this will be my first and last year experiencing them *IF* these can even happen.) I know there's been some work on doing this like still having U-Belong, Bingo, stuff-a-plush, and the winter carnival, but please keep it up. I don't care how many times I need to show my Co-verified or socially distance; I just want to still have the traditions that are part of why I fell in love with Lasell in the first place.",""

Rules surrounding friends in our room is understandable, but I feel as though if they live in our building, we should be able to have a certain number of people in our rooms. All students on campus are following protocol, so I don't understand why we can't have a max number of people in the rooms, as long as we are all following testing and covid protocols (I.E. green co verified badge.)

The process over the summer of deciding our plan for this year was difficult, other schools allowed students to know what format their classes would be before picking where they wanted to live for the semester. Also, i really believe lasell should have had student come back earlier and leave for good after thanksgiving. I think that planning to have us come back after break has caused anxiety in students because it could change at any moment. But overall i do think lasell has done a great job with keeping us safe and keeping us informed.

It's a waste. I can't believe I've spent thousands of dollars to attend a school with professors that do nothing but baby and bother us. They are overbearing and do not treat us like adults at all. They take attendance like it's kindergarten instead of just doing a quick 10 minute class recording about a lesson (like the good professoros do) and then just have us turn in our assignments when they're due. I don't understand why we're required to show up for weekly classes when we would be so much better off getting a quick lesson and just doing the work we need to do. It's ridiculous. I've gotten more value from my business coach than I've gotten from this school when it comes to tools for my career. Half of the classes I've taken are useless and unrelated to my career. Some of us actually know what we want to do coming out of college and really don't want to waste our time or money in classes that are not going to benefit us. Lasell should seriously stop being so strict with the major requirements because it's getting out of hand at this point. The fact that in Fashion Comm we randomly got required to take a second math class to graduate is absurd. I'm a transfer student and one of the reasons I chose to come to this school is because you guys took my math credits from my previous school. I'm thinking things are going smoothly and that I'm on track to graduate then you guys decide to add another math class to my major for no good reason. How is merchandising math supposed to help a Fashion comm major? Think about it. You guys should spend less time trying to collect our money and more time focusing on what is actually going to set us up for success. I'm not proud to be a student of this school at all and if I could go back in time and choose not to attend this school, I would. Each year being at this school has gotten more and more disappointing and I've had it. This school is the reason I would never force my children to attend college. I could have been fine in my career without attending this school. I've just wasted time and money that I can't get back and it makes me sick to think that I've learned more on my own about my career than this ""university"" has ever taught me.","Strongly Disagree","Strongly Disagree","Agree","Strongly Disagree","","Strongly Disagree","Strongly Disagree","Strongly Disagree","Strongly Disagree","Strongly Disagree","Strongly Disagree","Strongly Disagree","Registering for classes at this university has been one of the most stressful experiences in my life. You require me to take classes that are useless, but then don't provide the classes on the course catalog that I actually want to take and that I know personally will benefit me and help my career. This school is a joke. I'm paying you and in return you make it impossible for me to register for the classes I need to graduate and then don't offer the interesting classes that are in the course catalog. Every experience I've had with registering has been a nightmare because you people clearly don't know what you're doing.

The only items you can really count on is bread (bagels, toast), fruit, and the salad bar. The drink are great. The other foods are bland, or just are not appetizing. I got food poisoning once when I got the feta cheese in my salad. The past few weeks the options are even less. One of the things I was told when coming to the school was that the food was amazing. It is not. And as for 1851, every meal should be allowed a meal swipe. I quickly run out of dining dollars seeing as 1851 food quality is better. The late night food was removed this semester but that's when you get the best food. Then boomers was opened up at the dining hall but it was only dining dollars or real money. I am a broke student who would love a meal swipe option.  Also they are closed on weekends and close at 4:30 which is awful when it's the weekend and I can't get good food. I also don't think the time for the dining hall closing is good. On a Sunday I went to get dinner it was around 7 (which is a reasonable time to eat dinner) and the dining hall was closed. There are so many times when I try to just get a drink from the dining hall and they are closed and it is the middle of the day. Another time one weekend I went to get lunch around 12:30 and they weren't serving it until 1. I don't think the dining hall doors should lock in the middle of the day. Keep snacks and drinks available during meal changes. I loved the DeWitt food area because you could do a swipe for a drink and 2 snacks. It was perfect.

But on top of that, some students are left without housing options because they are ""too poor"" to afford housing during holiday breaks. That is not fair. That is inhuman. It's like were is my financial aid or loans going too? If I have to pay extra ($260 PER WEEK) to stay on campus. COVID makes things hard and resources scarce enough.
