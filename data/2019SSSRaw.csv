However, the regular dorms could have further renovations. After visiting other campuses to see friends, I feel our residence halls could seriously step up their game.

I think people rely on social media and yet we follow hundreds of accounts and may not see a post about what's happening. Plus I think people ignore posters a lot unfortunately.

",Agree,Agree,Agree,Agree,Agree,Strongly Agree,Disagree,Disagree,Disagree,"Honestly, I have friends who are conservative/republican and have several experiences where professors ostracize them in class and made to be the bad guy. Being liberal, I never noticed the bias undertones but some professors go so far to really belittle conservative Republicans. Also, campus police is definitely getting better but the beginning of the semester when trying to get my parking pass one was quite rude to me. He used a very rude tone and laughed at me when I asked if he needed my license, you know to prove I can drive a car? They also ignored my sticker and gave me several warnings that I was not parked in the right place and that I had no parking sticker at all when it was in the right place, plain as day. It doesn't instill a lot of confidence in me that tickets are very legit when given out since they can't even give adequate warnings for the right reason. ",Strongly Disagree,Strongly Disagree,Agree,"I know there's a salad bar, the grill, pizza, and international grill, but unfortunately people get sick of there being three consistent selections amongst an ever changing selection that is not even friendly to food allergies or vegan/vegetarians. There's this misconception that vegans and vegetarians enjoy this slop for food which is a bunch of vegetables mixed together and that is just false. This food is just not edible most the time. My friend whos gluten free can never find an adequate amount of food to eat. My friend who's allergic to dairy there's virtually nothing. Imagine having an allergy and being vegetarian? It seems like it's impossible but it's really not. If other schools can make it work why not ours? Stop mixing veggies with meats and vegetarians don't only eat this slimy tofu. As for the rest of options this over 7.99 nonsense needs to go away. Either make EVERYTHING a meal swipe at 1851 or don't. We're all going broke anyways so many of us personally don't think there should be dining dollars at all. We pay enough for the swipes, so why?

I have not stopped foot into health service since my freshman year and I am now a senior. They are not helpful at all and clearly sometimes do not know what they are talking about and i would rather spend money at an urgent care where I will actually be given something to make me better instead of worse. On top of that they all go to lunch at the same time leaving the office closed as some of the only times students can get there during the day. As well as they are awful at communicating stops on accounts for medical reasons. I never recommend healthier service to anyone. ,,They are never ever on time - does anyone literally even use them?,,,,,,I feel as though they do not really actively help students in the way that all students feel that they should.

I personally had an experience at Lasell that made me feel horrible.  A professor was treating me horribly and swearing at me in the classroom setting..   I reported him to the program director, got ZERO support.  Went to the dean of academic affairs Jim Ostrow.  Jim sent me straight back to my program director and the professor.  I was ridiculed, and told by my program director the ""professor has never sworn at a student"".  Horrible.  Is it really my duty to get proof of this kind of abuse?  To not be believed feels horrible.  Am I less than a student?  The political aspects that manipulate this institution should NOT impact students to the point where they are afraid to speak in class.  The program director is well aware of what occurs in the classroom, but refused to confront it.  This makes me feel horrible.  In a major of less than 10 people, it makes me feel forgotten as a student in my program.  The politics at this institution are impacting  the individual student experience.  You need to know that.  Again my issue is not that a professor swears in a classroom setting, we are all adults.  My issue is how my program director invalidated me, and furthermore refused to believe me.  This specific scenario I have shared caused me an immense amount of stress in the SP19 semester.  BOTH the professor and the program director mentioned how events like this could the quality of my recommendations .  I do not feel comfortable going to either of them, and would not feel comfortable asking for a recommendation.  I do not, in anyway, feel supported by my program director.

I have spoken to so many students that feel this way.  At numerous surrounding institutions, academic advisors are full time faculty.  We are overloading our already busy professors with a job they cannot do effectively.  People are not graduating on time, ignoring their advisor and just overall having feelings of discontent surrounding advisors.  How can an advisor who lives in Florida really provide adequate help for students.  Thats not fair.  Advisors need to be here.  Those students are being robbed of guidance they need.  First year advising is great, then you completely get forgotten.  Make advising a more integral part of the academic experience at Lasell.  Invest in fulltime upperclassman advising, they need it just as bad if not worse than first year students.

This would create a more respected feel for the unpopular events. ,"Lasell could do a much better job organizing support for events such as athletics. We have some very talented teams here and I feel like they are undersupported. The school should create a support ""Club"" or ""Pack"" for athletic support. Like a 'Lazer Squad"" or somethign clever where people meet to organize themes for athletics and create posters or banners prior to the events. This would create much more unity and an overall more welcoming feel. I also feel like the instagram for lasell athletics could be much more oganzid as it does look a little trashy. Secondly, the grounds could use improvement to be more inviting. Such as a more unified building labeling system that all say Lasell University not college. SOme building have signs out front and some have ones next to the doors... The school could do a much beter job unifying this and making thw whole campus feel larger by identifiying every building that may also just look like a residential house. Some of the walkways on campus could be redone and repaved or cleaned up such as the walkway past forest to the turf.

The person I spoke to from financial aid that day was extremely rude and told me that my family should have been more responsible and taken on more money than we can handle right on time. She even hung up on me. I cried after the call.

For the amount of money I give to this school I was appalled that my stop wouldn't be lifted for class registration because my one fairly large payment was just a day late, and was going to be made soon after. I actually ended up paying that same day. It made me feel like the school only cared about my money and let such a bad taste in my mouth. My worst Lasell experience to date. Also, I have not had the worst experience getting into my classes as a fashion major but my friends in majors that aren't as popular find that if what they have to  take fills up they don't have any other choices and they have to take elective courses or something that won't even count for their degree and might backtrack them.  tuition here is for sure ridiculous, as a fashion major my options are limited and I know that in the end, it'll be worth it but no doubt this school is extremely expensive especially to live here.

They don't clean off some of the plates completely, and you can see food on it from the previous person, which can spread illness and it is life threatening for people with allergies.

When I told them this they said to come back tomorrow but if I was seriously  sick they should not make me wait.  All I wanted was to get listened to I didn't even need an exam. I was very upset by this because seeing my mom in the ER all because her shift is ending she is not going to stop taking care of a patient or refuse to help them. I also watched them turn away a girl who was suppose to get tested  for strep throat and was told to go there to be Checked and she had to wait till tomorrow or the next day because they she to close. That is again very unacceptable because she could need antibiotic and potentially contaminating other people. The nurse that finally saw me was of no help she told me that I should not have a cough basically because I don't has Asthma and so she didn't understand.

There is a solid difference in organization of the classes and I find many many HEM courses are NOT organized and it's very frustrating when the professors do not communicate what they need or want from students.

I believe in History, the professors all care more about their individualized sections than the large group. I believe in ethics, not a single professor besides Tom Sullivan couldn't care any less about any ethic assignment at all.
